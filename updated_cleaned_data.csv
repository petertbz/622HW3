&gt; What Is Quantitative Easing (QE)?

&gt;When a central bank decides to use QE, it makes large-scale purchases of financial assets, like government and corporate bonds and even stocks. This relatively simple decision triggers powerful outcomes: The amount of money circulating in an economy increases, which helps lower longer-term interest rates. This lowers the cost of borrowing, which spurs economic growth.

The fed unleashed 9t of QE since 2010.

You can google QE and theres plenty of articles detailing the feds actions regarding its balance sheet etc.

Housing affordability is a combination of prices and rates. Rates were near 20% in the 80s, but people were still able to afford homes because prices weren't out of control. You could save interest-bearing money for a downpayment and still afford a home.

Four years ago this week, the first wave of what would grow to be 20 million job losses set in, although most Americans were more terrified of catching a new, very transmissible, and sometimes fatal, virus. Toilet paper was nowhere to be found, but at least it was cheaper than it is now, along with most groceries.

In the months to follow, the pandemic recession was largely recognized by global and political leaders as a severe economic trauma. And the swift and almost miraculous recovery of the U.S. economy has been the [envy of the world](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/28/global-economy-gdp-inflation/?itid=lk_inline_manual_3).

The one lasting challenge for the U.S. economy that permeates nearly every benchmark of economic health is inflation. Price increases are finally easing, but not before taking a toll on all Americans, shaping how they feel about everything.

A new normal has settled into the U.S. economy  one that nobody could have predicted four years ago.

Signs that the U.S. economy is flipping from goldilocks to stagflation have multiplied recently, according to Michael Hartnett, a BofA Global equity strategist. The shift could have serious ramifications for the stock market that many investors arent yet taking seriously.

Stagflation refers to simultaneously elevated inflation and weak economic growth, which bedeviled the U.S. economy for most of the 1970s and into the early 1980s. Goldilocks refers to when an economy is growing at a moderate pace thats not hot enough to stoke inflation.

Earlier this week, investors digested two hotter-than-expected inflation reports. Consumer prices rose at a rate of 3.2% over the past 12 months, and the rate could accelerate to 3.6% by June, Hartnett said.

Traders are currently pricing in more than 50% probability that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in June, for the first time since it began raising them in March 2022, according to the CME Groups FedWatch Tool.

Signs of a revival in inflation arent confined to the U.S., Hartnett said. Accelerating price pressures around the world have already inspired some emerging-markets central banks to pause plans to cut interest rates.",2,O,N

If an AI suddenly causes significant damages, rules will be changed prior to full collapse because protecting personal wealth is the great societal unifier. 

Most means of collapse are avoidable. The governments would eventually agree to call it a mulligan, sort things out, and society would survive because were all just folks in the end.




Long answer: The current AI is based on advanced search algorithms and is poorly regulated market. Either there will be a problem allowed by lack of regulation that gets people killed or causes a rapid/unpredicted change in the market. After the SNAFU, either a governing body will regulate AI or the first group to map the marketplace to the point where it can monitor/manipulate all other AI will take control.

Next Gen AI will resolve the fidelity problem (Skynet scenarios) by having dedicated teams of experts moderating the results to prevent catastrophic liabilities. Right now, if any of the AI firms move too quickly and they fuck up along the way, thats their ass, so the likelihood of an unintentional Skynet happening in the next 3 years low.

After ~3 years, we may reach the Sauron problem, in which a 2nd Gen Econ AI tries to corner some market by being trained to manipulate the first generation AI. However, creating such a disastrous AI is problematic for all players, so legislation will probably be passed to prevent it.

If a foreign power tries to ratfuck other countries using a Sauron AI, that would be bad. But if it crashes the stock market or turns off electric grids, etc, the economy would still be correctable, though a war economy isnt fun.",3,N,N

I appreciate the additional details. If you're happy then stay in that mindset because that's already a positive. But in reality, in 2024 with how much inflation we've experienced and how much of it is greedflation from monopolies and deregulation and bailouts with our tax dollars, yes that is now shit wages where you will have to rent for the rest of your life (unless you have parents with a lot of money to help), and it's not your fault, but it's also silly to say that because of your anecdote everything is sunshine and rainbows in the US.  
  
You are young and living out in the middle of nowhere in presumably a very low cost of living area (not hard to find in bumfuck Ohio of all places), so I can't use you as an example to get a pulse on how *everyone* is doing, especially because when you're young you're just happy to not have to have roommates or be away from parents.

With the conflict in Ukraine and the U.S. shipping gas to Europe and expanding into China.

South and Central American countries are reliant on a higher price of oil.  A state like Venezuela is entirely dependent on a higher price of oil.

The U.S. has sanctions on Venezuela that negatively impacts its economy.

The U.S. while all this has been happening has not focused on cost of living increases or inflation.  We are on the brink of a major recession.  How we calculate consumer price increases and inflation was changed a few decades ago and the numbers being reported are not a good indication of the state of our economy.  The status of our economy has nothing to do with the strength of Wall Street.  The stock prices of 30-500 multi national corporations do not reflect the health of tens of millions of American businesses.

This is why the price of oil dropped, and what is contributing to the destabilization of South and Central American states leading to the increases in immigration.

If anyone wanted to solve the issue of immigration we would be removing the rest of the sanctions on Venezuela, and cutting production of oil and gas.

Preventing the manipulation by large business and banks of the market through their consolidation, creating manufactured supply line shortages.  Prices for fuel are already starting to increase again due to preventable refinery and infrastructure closures...This will lead to significant cost of living increases and shotgun everyone straight into a recession.

The U.S. should have significantly reduced the shipping of gas overseas and developed better relations with Venezuela at the start of Bidens administration, instead he went the other route.

The U.S. should also pressure Europe to take in refugees from and send increasing amounts of aid to their former African colonies that only gained independence in the 60s.  If the E.U. refuses to comply just stop sending aid and funding to pay for the deficit in costs caused by African immigration to the U.S.

I think we're at the point where studies will show whatever the people funding them want them to show.

Immigration of skilled workers with jobs awaiting for them is clearly a benefit for the economy as a whole (but they so suppress wages for Americans) while uneducated undocumented and criminally unvetted immigrants is a different story with very different cost-benefit math.

&gt;Only 44% of Americans surveyed said they **could** use their savings to pay for an unexpected expense

So lets read the underlying report.
&gt;Many would borrow in an emergency. Only 44% of U.S. adults **would** pay an emergency expense of $1,000 or more from their savings, as of December 2023 polling. 35% would borrow money, including 21% who would finance with a credit card 

There is a big difference between ""could"" and ""would"".   Now seeing that I am getting ""Low Current Balance Alert"" from my credit union, I'm not particularly liquid at this time, but I would be by the time my credit card that I would use for the $1000 expense is due.  

The credit card is my emergency funding source.   
(The reason for that low balance message is because the credit union insults my intelligence with their low interest rates.)",3,O,N

I ""wouldn't"" use debit because federal price controls makes it economically stupid to carry large balances at banks, but I easily could maintain a $1000 balance at the bank, or a $10,000 balance, or a $100,000 balance.

It's not considered an economy imo. players that enable other players to become rich in an economy and scam other players to benefit themselves without punishment isn't an economy. that's just called being evil and stealing. if another player can steal from a poor player, poor player is allowed to steal from rich player. to be a functioning economy is to follow strict laws and rules that protect and apply to each player regardless of society status, family name, etc

an economy that is pay to win at life isn't an economy. many top players today, pay to win and stay indefinitely. 

capitalism, social, comm, imp, etc? all economic systems are better if designed impartial and fair to every player, that is what we want

In regards to Israel, I would agree with you. AIPAC is an extremely powerful lobby, many Jewish politicians are dual citizens, and many evangelical Christians in America believe in Christian Zionism which is essentially supportive of the state of Israel. 

However, the Russia Ukraine thing is much different. Much of America is actually Russophobia due to the long Cold War which is indelible in the minds of Boomers as much as Christian Zionism is. Its unquestionable to them that Israel is good and Russia is bad. 

I highly doubt Russia has anywhere near as much political power in the U.S. to actually be a significant reason as to why the legislation for providing support to Ukraine is held up. There is a genuine feeling of resent meant in many Americans that the administration is characterizing Russia-Ukraine war as a threat to our security but exacerbating the problem at the Southern Border. You may disagree with that assessment and thats fine. However, it is a legitimate good faith belief by many Americans. How do I know? Because I share it. I say this as someone who in their professional capacity is deeply involved with providing the material assistance to Ukraine from the DOD.  

The final aspect of the Russia-Ukraine issue is that there is not really any conceivable scenario where Ukraine actually wins. Another hard to swallow pill but it is the truth. Theres a mix of reasons why and the holdup of aid right now probably isnt in the top 5. The biggest issues are manpower, air superiority, integration, and mass.

To provide you an example. Ill use fake numbers to just illustrate the problem and not get close to real data. Say Ukraine has 100 artillery pieces. They have roughly 50 in 155mm donated from NATO and 50 in 152mm which are what they started the war with from their Soviet times. Even if the west gives them near unlimited 155mm rounds they will still only be firing 50 guns at any given time. Its incredibly hard for the west to get any 152mm ammunition because many dont actually make it and those who do arent exactly friendly to us (Russia, China, NK, Iran). Now lets say Russia has 200 or 250 artillery pieces. They can fire nearly all pieces all day because they dont have the same integration issues of 155mm that Ukraine does. Ukraine will never be able to keep up with volume of fire. 

I could go on and on in regards to air supremacy, lessened utility of armor, drone usage, etc. 

With that known, why should the US pour hundreds of billions into a loss? Sure, it hurts Russia but its also dragging on a war that if it isnt negotiated to a close soon may see a total collapse of the UAF which would result in the complete seizure of Ukraine as opposed to maybe just Donbas if negotiated.

It essentially combines the significance of the stock movements when a report is released, with the correlation it has with cool &amp; hot inflation  
The math behind it:  
For each inflation report released since Jan of 2022, I recorded if the reported inflation was above or below the consensus. Then, I calculated the returns of the stock on those days that the inflation reports were published. I then converted the percent returns to movements measured in standard deviations. Then, I compiled the average movements in STD DEVS for the times when reported inflation was -0.3 , -0.2 , -0.1, 0.1 , 0.2, and 0.3 percentage points below/above the consensus. Then, I measured the Reactivity taking the average of all the movements when inflation was below/above the consensus. This is how much (in standard deviations) a stock will move on average when inflation is below/ above the consensus. Then, I found the correlation (R\^2) that the movements had with the degree to which the inflation was above/below. In theory, a stock with complete influence from inflation should have a perfect linear relation (Losing more when inflation is hot, gaining more when inflation is cool, or perfectly vice versa). By then multiplying the R\^2 by the Reactivity, the Influence is found. This metric essentially means the degree to which this stock will react to an above/below consensus inflation report in a linear and predictable manner.

Whether it's good or bad depends entirely on whether the credit is used to increase aggregate supply or aggregate demand.

For example, let's say a local shoemaker gives the baker down the street a pair of new shoes on credit. They're old friends, the baker fell on hard times due to a grain shortage, and the shoemaker knows the baker is good for it and is happy to help him out because he knows it's a tough time.

That would be neutral or even beneficial.

Now let's say it's ten years down the road, the grain shortage is over, and the baker is doing booming business. He needs to expand his operation by installing more ovens. The guy down the street who makes the ovens advances him said ovens, and the baker pays him back over time with interest.

So that neutral creation of credit got the baker through the rough times and now he's using credit to increase aggregate supply.

Where things go off the rails is when credit is misused/abused to increase aggregate demand without increasing aggregate supply. Like if someone takes out a loan to buy a new car they can't really afford just because they want their neighbors to think they're rich.

Whenever you use credit, you're artificially increasing the money supply to buy something you actually can't afford. Since money is representative of goods and services, you're basically trading your future labor output for current goods and services. If you use the borrowed money to increase your output (like the baker buying more ovens), then you've used credit responsibly. But if you use it in ways that undermine your future output, like making irresponsible purchases, then you've undermined the entire economy by printing money that won't be met by a proportional increase in supply.

When you get lots of people using credit irresponsibly, the supply of money goes up faster than the supply of goods and services, and that's what destroys economies and currencies. Unfortunately, human nature being what it is, you can always count on it. Every economy and every currency will end up being destroyed in the end by consumer greed. That's why we get credit cycles and related boom bust cycles, and that's why people who understand that basic principle can consistently make money in the markets.",1,N,N

I've tried to explain it to random people online, friends and family (to warn them what's about to happen), and nobody even begins to get it.

As for how much longer it can continue, I don't know. Considering we're at the point now where people are literally financing cups of coffee, I have to think the end is near. But whether that's next week or a decade from now, I don't know. Nobody does. People in the early 1980s thought the end of the dollar was then, and then China opened to the west and created a whole new market for US debt.

The wildcard right now is immigration. If we can import enough warm bodies into our economy, we can increase GDP, increase demand for goods and services, and, eventually, increase demand for new loans. It seems the plan is to get these fresh immigrants into the military and rapidly transform them into debt slaves, which could hypothetically work, if it's done on a large enough scale and rapidly enough.

We need to expand the money supply by about ten trillion dollars practically overnight. That would stop the deflation in money supply and get the economy growing again, bring interest rates back down, and the newly minted Americans would create enough demand to keep the currently saturated debt slaves employed. And we would get to survive another few years, perhaps even a decade or more.

I doubt it's going to work with 100% success. I imagine the reality will land somewhere between abysmal failure and spectacular success.

I think its kind of hard to grasp overall just how capitalism and the economy truly works. Most people understand the basic premises but dont really analyze whats going on or how money moves or works (especially when talking inflation, credit, interest, debts, and tax rates). It seems simple but factoring in over expenditure, debts like never before seen, cost of living rising well above average wages, and how people are financing basic things, the way it all comes together can be a little mind boggling or hard to understand. Speaking for myself, just coming up with these questions, it truly starts to make less sense to me how any of it works in reality. 

I know In principle (like the example you gave with the shoemaker and the baker) that it makes more sense, but we know thats not how it truly is working on the grand scale. The elites and the powers that be always used financing and debt to give the average person spending power and ability to obtain goods, services, vehicles, and property, but what if these debts get to proportions (such as student loan debt) where its almost unimaginable that all of that can be paid back. Im saying that as a rhetorical question. I know I basically asked that in a number of different ways already, but its just really interesting to me the way the economy is going and how it all works. The mass amount of debt the average person takes on is something that scares me.

One of my assessments is that the rich or elite class of today are far greedier then ever before and they keep allowing (like weve always) the average person to take on financing and debt at higher levels (student loans example) to appear as if profits or money flow is generating upwards in profits. However I think its creating a vortex to where so much of it is on credit/financing that they over extended there hand in giving out money, and the average American is over extended in ever being able to pay that off while also having a family, shelter, and basic needs. (Including all overall debts here). That in turn is going to create a burst at some point I think when it overlaps and people can no longer even sustain themselves alongside the debt.

That means all monetary systems are inherently ponzi schemes.

This is unavoidable. It's unavoidable because you can't stop people from creating credit. Like the government could ban banks and ban lending, but they can't stop people from loaning each other money or fronting them goods and services for interest. I mean look at the entire illicit drug trade, that's how it works, and they obviously can't stop it. So credit is an unavoidable part of any economy. You can't stop it, and you can't stop people from being stupid with it.

Now the degree to which the system can get out of control can be limited. Like before the creation of the federal reserve, there was a very minor (by today's standards) boom bust cycle every five to ten years. It's trying to prevent these boom bust cycles that is really the greatest evil in our economy. Doing everything they can to keep kicking the can down the road.

The boom bust cycles are necessary to reset the credit and prevent hyperbubbles from forming. Honestly, I think the answer is really imposing busts vs trying to prevent them.

There's a reason governments spend so many taxpayer dollars digging their economies out of recessions. Families lose their homes. Children go malnourished. New grads spend years struggling to get their careers back on track, forgoing marriage and kids and homeownership. But a growing body of research suggests that recessions are good for at least one thing: longevity. Puzzlingly, it appears that economic downturns actually extend people's lives.

The latest evidence comes from ""[Lives vs. Livelihoods](https://www.nber.org/papers/w32110),"" a new paper by four researchers led by the renowned health economist Amy Finkelstein. They found that during the Great Recession, from 2007 to 2009, age-adjusted mortality rates among Americans dropped 0.5% for every jump of 1 percentage point in an area's unemployment rate. The more joblessness, the longer people lived  especially adults over 64 and those without a college education.

""These mortality reductions appear immediately,"" the economists concluded, ""and they persist for at least 10 years."" The effects were so large that the recession effectively provided 4% of all 55-year-olds with an extra year of life. And in states that saw big jumps in unemployment, people were more likely to report being in excellent health. Recessions, it would seem, help us stay fitter, and live longer.

The question, of course, is why. The economists ruled out a lot of possible explanations. Laid-off workers weren't using their free time to exercise more, or cutting back on smoking or drinking because money was tight. Infectious diseases like influenza and pneumonia kept right on spreading, even though fewer people were going to work and dining out. Retirees didn't seem to be getting better care, even though rising unemployment rates made it easier for nursing homes to staff up. So what could the explanation be? How does higher unemployment lead to longer life?

The answer was pollution. Counties that experienced the biggest job losses in the Great Recession, the economists found, also saw the largest declines in air pollution, as measured by levels of the fine particulate matter PM2.5. It makes sense: During recessions, fewer people drive to work. Factories and offices slow down, and people cut back on their own energy use to save money. All that reduced activity leads to cleaner air. That would explain why workers without a college degree enjoyed the biggest drops in mortality: People with low-wage jobs tend to live in neighborhoods with more environmental toxins. It would also explain why the recession reduced mortality from heart disease, suicide, and car crashes  causes of death all linked to the physical and mental effects of PM2.5. Overall, the economists found, cleaner air was responsible for more than a third of the decline in mortality during the Great Recession.",1,N,N

I don't know of any first time homebuyers that bought a brand new home (unless of course theyre very wealthy, which aren't the types we're talking about). New and expensive homes are reserved for people who have the money to buy them... many of which who've spent years building equity. There are older affordable homes all over the usa. I'm in Northern Illinois west of Chicago. There are move in ready homes in towns all around me that are selling for less than $125k. Sure, it's not downtown Chicago, it's not LA, it's not Boulder, it's not Manhattan. It isn't glamorous and it won't make you feel warm and fuzzy like you're rich, but they are solid and sealed homes with plumbing, heat and air, and most importantly affordable.  




You don't need a new car. Hell, you don't even need a car loan. If you want to buy a house, spending thousands more than what a car is worth just so you can have something fancy is not money smart. Right now, I'm driving a 05 Subaru Forester with almost 300,000 miles. For work, I regularly drive 100 miles per day. I have all the faith in this car. I've had it for more than a year and have had zero unexpected issues. You can purchase a similar car in most markets for a couple thousand dollars. It doesn't have heated seats or heated steering wheel. It doesn't have the greatest stereo. It doesn't look like a new KIA (but will run longer). It isn't fast. But, it's reliable and gets good fuel mileage. The amount of young people I've met these last few years that complain they'll never own a home, yet owe tens of thousands on a car, is astonishing. A car loan is just throwing away your money and if you don't have much, it's nothing more than a flashy anchor.


No new jobs? Between the last 3 months, weren't there something like 600,000 jobs added to the market? There are decent paying jobs out there. Maybe it isn't exactly what you want to do. Maybe it's not glamorous. Maybe it's boring. But if it pays your bills and allows you to live a life outside is work, who cares? I'm in construction. It's dirty. It's loud. It's dangerous. It's either very hot and humid or very cold. I'm not a big fan of the work and it's no passion of mine. But, it pays me very well and affords me great benefits. It allows me to spend life outside of work however I want to spend it.


Sometimes in life, you have to sacrifice a want for a need. Nothing is perfect. I get it, 30 years ago, life was different. Many of you think it was easier. But, we don't live 30 years ago. We live today. It sucks, but you might not get everything you want out of life. But, do your best to do your best and you'll most likely do better than those that don't.

I agree. But, that doesn't mean all of those jobs are only in HCOL areas. Just like how there are affordable homes *not* in HCOL areas, there are decent paying jobs not in HCOL areas. From facilities maintenance, to construction, to HR, to janitorial, to factory or manufacturing work... there are good paying jobs out there, it's just many people don't want those jobs for whatever


Yes, there are unreliable used cars out there. Some people do get unlucky (but why are we pointing that out? You could do everything right and still fail. Pointing out people *can* be unlucky is a defeatest attitude and part of the problem i am addressing). There are also unreliable brand new cars out there. Anybody can educate themselves on which cars to look for and which cars to stay away from. That info is free and accessible on the internet. There's also a plethora of information on how cars work and how to buy a used car, what to look for and what problems exist. Considering the expense that vehicles are, it's a topic anybody would do well to educate themselves on. 


I think one of the main problems facing young people today is mixed properties. People are prioritizing a pretty car over a good car. They're prioritizing what they want to do for work, over what pays the bills. They're prioritizing the fancy new thing over the thing they already own that still works. They're prioritizing a HCOL area over what makes financial sense. 


I also think there's an issue of attitude. We are in a temporary economy. It changes constantly with time. Yet, people are absolutely convinced they'll *never* be able to own a home or retire, then spend their money like those things are never going to happen. It's only a matter of time before markets turn around for the better like they have multiple times in my and my parents lives. But, if you continue to prioritize your money on things you don't need (like a new car over a used car), then you really never will be able to afford a home or retire. The market will turn back around and those that are planning for it today will be the ones to capitalize when the time is right. 


While I agree with everything you've stated, I don't believe any of it points to anything wrong with my original statements.


My advice for anybody worried is to plan ahead. Take good care of your credit. Balance your budget the best you can and save as much as humanly possible, even if it's $25 per paycheck or whatever. There are first time home buyer programs that allow for as little as 2% down and closing costs can be negotiated. If you're ready when prices and rates come down, you'll be able to buy a home. ",17_1_1,F,N

And you get the cheapest flights by booking in advance and avoiding peak seasonal travel.

There's even a beach town near me that has restaurants that are 50% off everything in the off season. Which means normal prices (it's double in the summer).

The question is whether we compress the season into a day. Should it be cheaper to eat at a restaurant after the lunch rush?

Some cities have dynamic tolls that are higher during rush hour, for example.

Ultimately, I think it boils down to inequality. If you get the big bucks, you can do anything you want whenever you want. You can smoke in elevators. You can park literally anywhere any time. The fines are trivial for these things. But if society doesn't give you a high income, you can't do certain things at all and there are some things you can only do some of the time or during certain times.

Society wants to use dynamic pricing to thin the crowd and create a better experience for the richest people. But we've seen this play out a thousand times. The rich people are already on a hedonic treadmill and have achieved their max happiness. So taking services and activities from poor people to give them to rich people only makes happiness inequality worse. We are sacrificing the extensive margin (the extent to which poor people can do things) for the intensive margin (the intensity of rich people's experiences).",2,N,N

&gt;If approved by parliament and the president, the legislation will allow almost 200,000 people employed in the sector to receive an additional 1,000 zloty (¬230) gross each per month starting from July. For those on the minimum wage, that would boost their earnings by almost 25%.

&gt;Social workers perform a difficult job that requires specialised knowledge and competences and they do so on a daily basis with full dedication and must be rewarded accordingly, said Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-Bk, the minister for family, labour and social policy.

&gt;

&gt;The measure will cover those working in the foster care and family support system, social care units  such as social assistance centres, crisis intervention centres and support centres  as well as childcare facilities for children up to the age of three  such as nurseries  that are run by local governments.

&gt;Over the last two years, I have very often met social workers in Polish local authorities. They are mainly women, with higher education, said Prime Minister Donald Tusk. He noted that they undertake very hard work but it is sometimes humiliating because they earn less than those they are helping.

&gt;He highlighted that an overwhelming majority are paid the [minimum wage](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/06/14/poland-plans-record-minimum-wage-rise/), which, as of January, stands at 4,242 zloty (¬980) per month. I insisted on preparing a solution for them, he added.

&gt;

&gt;The proposed bill would provide subsidies to local governments in order for them to make the extra payments to social care workers. Dziemianowicz-Bks ministry estimates that around 190,000 people working in the sector would be covered.

&gt;The bill will now be sent to parliament, where the government has a majority in both chambers. It must also then be signed by President Andrzej Duda, who is an opponent of the government but during his term in office has been supportive of measures to boost pay and social support.

&gt;I am counting on very quick work in parliament and a very quick signing by the president. I dont think he will be opportunistic here, Tusk added.

A significant swath of Americans now expect to spend almost 40 years in retirement, with about 1 in 8 workers planning to stop working before they turn 61. At the same time, most workers say they want to live until they're 100. 

That means some workers are eyeballing a four-decade retirement, an ambitious goal that comes with serious downsides. Among them: How to fund almost 40 years of retirement at a time when most workers are far from reaching their savings goals. 

The findings, from a recent survey from financial services firm Corebridge Financial, underscore the gap between Americans' lofty dreams for their golden years versus their financial realities. The median retirement savings balance for people who are between 55 to 64  just years from potentially stepping back from work  is $185,000, according to NerdWallet.

""100 is a very long and fulfilling life, and that's pretty optimistic and great to see,"" Bryan Pinsky, president of individual retirement at Corebridge Financial, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""That optimism and hope does come with a little bit of tension  only 27% are very or extremely confident that they won't outlive their retirement savings.""

If the inflation wasn't justified by anything other than the desire for increased profits, then reducing those exploitative prices would be good for the  economy by allowing the money to be saved, which is supposedly a goal, or invested, another good goal, or diverted away  from corporate coffers into local businesses.

Aahh, there, I see the problem: corporate profits will shrink and the extremely wealthy will suffer emotional distress. we can't have that, of course, they are too emotionally fragile. Wage growth is out of the question as well, since that is inflationary, too.

The usual arguments against deflation concerns a lot of nonsensical crap about people putting off buying stuff because it will be cheaper in the future. That ignores the reality that a very great deal of what people buy is inelastic. Food, for instance. No one can put off buying food for a month in hopes that it will be cheaper then. they can't put off paying rent.

The ""deflation is bad argument"" is about luxury items, not everyday necessities. Just because some things might suffer reduced sales, the slack will be picked up elsewhere. The money not spent there will wind up being invested elsewhere, creating demand and jobs. Oh, I forgot, to fight inflation economists think that the best method is to destroy demand by destroying jobs, so people can't afford to buys stuff, and then prices won't rise so fast. Makes perfect sense, right? Also, ""invested elsewhere"" means competition and no good capitalist wants that.

Food prices could easily be restored to pre-pandemic levels without hurting the economy, and corporations could be satisfied with less than record profits year after year. Deflation isn't the bad thing capitalist economists try to make out it is.",13_1_1,O,N

I think any comparison that ignores mortgage interest rates is missing something important.


In 1985 the average mortgage rate was 13%.  Assuming you financed the entire 83k average home price that means your monthly payment would have been around 900, which works out to about 47% of the stated annual income.


Assuming a 30 year at 7% in 2022 for the full median home price we get a payment of around 3k which works out to about 50% of the median income.


So, not that I'm on the side of boomers at all on this shit, but in a sense it is not that far off.  47% vs 50%.  You can definitely say homes are more expensive now, but it's hard to make the argument that it's all that drastic.


Things that a better analysis would consider is whether the median is a great measure in all cases here.  I imagine the distribution of home values and incomes looks a bit different now than it did in 85.  I would also like to know how property taxes, fees, insurance, and other costs of ownership factor in.  I have been in the market recently and we definitely have an affordability issue, but I'm not sure that this simple plot really provides much in understanding it.  Once you take mortgage rates into account it looks more or less on trend to me.",1_1_1,N,N

&gt;One of the main problems with selling housing deregulation is the perception that new construction only benefits the rich.  Rich developers of course, but also rich home-buyers.  Its easy to see where casual observers get this idea.  New housing is usually nice housing, because over time technology improves and capital depreciates.  Since richer people are more willing to pay the upcharge for nicer housing, the future residents of new construction are usually well-to-do.

&gt;So what do casual observers miss?  They miss the big picture: People who move into new construction are moving away from older construction.  When they move, those older units become available for others.  While those others probably wont be drastically poorer than those they replace, they tend to be slightly poorer.  Think: one rung down.  When these slightly poorer people move, their prior dwellings will tend to be taken over by those who are a further rung down.  And so on, in a great chain reaction.

As rates came down, the square footage rose.

So the comparable  median income is $56,688 and the median home price would be $199,680.  So the  houses back then cost about 3.5 times annual salary. 
Now consider that the median home size in 1985 was 1,650 square feet.

Also, Im not sure why theyre using median instead of average.  The average home price in 2022 was only $348,000, not $468,000.  Also, home prices have already dropped significantly from their 2022 high. The 2023 median home price was only $417,700. 

The median home size in 2022 is 2,522 square feet, which is $165 per square foot. So if you were to buy a house in 2023 that was built in 2022, and was the same size as the houses in 1985, it would cost $272,500.  Or about 3.65 times your annual salary.

U.S. population in 2024: 342 million

Mechanization and trade has revolutionized U.S. food production, so agricultural workers now make up less than 2% of the U.S. worker population, compared to rough half in 1900. (This is why less than 1 in 10 illegal immigrant workers even toil in agriculture.) More and more rural small towns continue to empty out due to lack of job and other opportunities.

Automation and offshoring and trade means less than 8% of U.S. workers sweat it out in manufacturing, as opposed to the peak back in the late 1970s. Thousands of small factory towns across America have been hollowed out.

Computerization, offshoring, and AI means less and less need for knowledge workers. The peak was around the year 2000. And yet even though perhaps 1 in 10 adult Americans had a bachelors degree were higher back in the 1970s, 1 in 3 do now, and amongst Millennials it is roughly 1 in 2. This is why a significant portion of college graduates are working at jobs that do not require college degree at all.

The vast majority (over 90%) of net new jobs created in the U.S. over the past 20+ years have been of the kinds that are part time, temporary, lower paid, few oe no benefits, gigs or apps-based.

The overall trend is, fewer and fewer good paying jobs and exponentially explosive population growth - whether through reproduction, people living and working longer, or immigration (both legal and illegal).

Some clueless people proclaim that the United States is a very large country and there is lots of space. But all the jobs and desirable housing or concentrated.

That kind of concentration means intense competition for jobs and intense competition for housing.

When labor is scarce, wages rise, better benefits are offered, full time positions are offered.

When labor supply is oversaturated, employers (buyers or labor) can offer lower wages, offer fewer benefits, etc.

This is true in the overall labor market, and for specific skill sets. I remember even back in the 1990s, college graduates with.degrees in library science, biology, and English were struggling for jobs in their fields, though at least they could find some decent jobs. But theres also goes for manufacturing work, warehouse work, transportation, hospitality, food service, groundskeeping and maintenance, etc.

The current classic example is ride sharing and delivery apps. Youve got everyone competing: seniors, college students and college graduates, high school graduates and high school dropouts, single parents and stay-at-home parents, immigrants (legal and illegal with fake IDs), etc.

Same with housing. You wonder how people can afford housing? Many young adults are living with parents are combining money as roommates to bid on housing. When I was last renting in Southern California, we had upstairs neighbors who were three young women, each with their respective boyfriends. before that, in a condo I was renting there were 3 immigrant families occupying the 3-bedroom condo next to us, and on thr other side, 2 families occupied a 2-bedroom unit. The math is simple: 1 or 2 working adults are not going to have an easy time competing for housing against 6 adults earning even if thr 6 each earn less money.

Its all about supply and demand and all about math.

In a pure capitalistic economy, maybe you are right. Things won't necessarily be started without the help of subsidies, I don't see an issue with that. Overall, the capitalistic economy to seek profit is what ultimately drives innovation and cost reduction that we all benefit from.

Not true at all, the government doesn't subsidize every innovative thought people have. It may subsidize *some* ideas the government sees as important but the vast majority of innovation is not subsidized.


Get real.


&gt;China is not profit driven, they are growth driven, which in turn increases profits, but that profit is a consequence, not the main objective.

The efficiency of that funding may be greater than, sadly, a smaller population of cancer victims. 

The printing of more money can devalue the dollar due to inflationary response of doing so...  so it's actually important to ensure taxation and proper debt balancing with credit-worthy bodies. I thought we could just print infiniteomey too, and I don't think the good provided would actually devalue the dollar enough for those who are in need. 

My guess, right now, is that EU and Middle East feel unstable, and US is a great exporter of military goods and services, so our government leans on that to debt finance our allies (and likely our enemies too). Depending on the credit worthiness of those countries, the US stands to increase the value of its dollar, or to gain in interest from those countries. I'm not sure I know how to explain this well enough...

Whereas there is no direct benefit to debt financing those who need the charity money - they likely aren't credit worthy enough... It's sad, but true. 

With the last statement -- but just to caveat that I'm still figuring out how to explain this myself and may over  generalize here -- crony capitalism plays into this... While some may say the standard of living has or is getting better more broadly (this may be challenged more recently), lack of progressive tax policy is leaving behind the lower and middle classes due to the response (inflation) of printing too much money, and that money being in the hands of the ultra wealthy to invest in things that will continue to increase profit. Where do the needy fit into this equation? The answer: they don't...

So charities are there as an 'altruistic' tax, not enforced by government policy, but perhaps beneficial with tax credits for some. 

I would be interested to see the correlation of charity $ volume during more versus less wealth inequality in the US. 

If your charity serves people in other countries, then that may just be another channel for supplying aid... In a way, it's through a tax system, not just simply printing money. If it is through printing money and sending it across, there should be some deal to pay it back (and generally serving needy populations can pay back if the government of the needy is not corrupt). In the case where debt cannot be paid back, political conflict can errupt. Jeffrey Sachs describes this in ""The End of Poverty"".

1) We don't print money to fund the military. We print money to pay for deficit spending which is ALL government spending that is more than revenue. Some of it is military, some is Food Stamps, some funds the Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (to the tune of $500 Million) and other useless spending. 

2) It would be nice if we could just print money to pay for all the things we want but printed money causes inflation and I think we all agree that we don't like inflation.

3) We do have a resource problem. There is a finite amount of income we can tax and the history of taxation shows that taxes which are inherently excessive are not paid The high rates inevitably put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive business and invest it in tax-exempt securities or to find other lawful methods of avoiding the realization of taxable income.
